# Visionar
The simplest way to integrate Augmented Reality into your own app.

Visionar provides a simple [web application](https://www.visionar.com/product-visionar-studio/) to upload and create your own augmented reality content for your mobile apps. Visionar also already provides iOS and android Apps. So no programming skills are required. 

This SDK is only needed, if you want to connect your own app with the visionar content. This has the advantage of your own branding or extending the app with your own features. 

This repository contains the visionar iOS SDK and an example project on how to integrate the visionar sdk into your own app. 

To learn more, visit the [visionar website](https://www.visionar.com). 

# Prerequisites
- Visionar is build on top of ARKit and requires iOS 12 or later.
- Xcode 10 or later

> The example project was created with iOS 13 and Xcode 11.2.1.

# Getting started

## Example Project
The easiest way to get started is to use the example project and set your visionar app key in `ViewController.swift`:

``` swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    // Insert your visionar AppKey here
    let appKey = ""
    
    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
        let vc = segue.destination as! ARViewController
        vc.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
        vc.appKey = appKey
    }
}
```
> The app key can be found inside the visionar app applikation. Each project has it's own app key. 

And thats it! Start your app, navigate to your `ARViewController` and scan the targets, previsouly uploaded via the visionar studio web applikation. 

## Integrate into your existing project

### Setting up with CocoaPods
1. Install [CocoaPods] (https://cocoapods.org/)
2. Run `pod repo update` to make CocoaPods aware of the latest available versions.;
3. In your Podfile, add `use_frameworks!` and `pod 'VARkit', '~> 1.0'`
4. From the command line, run `pod install`
5. Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project!

### Setting up with Carthage
We currently do not support carthage, but we consider it for future versions.

### Allow access to the camera
Augmented reality needs access to your devices camera. To do so, open the Info.plist file and set the `NSCameraUsageDescription`.

### VARViewController
`import VARkit` on top of your ViewController, subclass the `VARViewController` and set the view controllers `appKey` variable in the `prepare (for segue...)` function.

``` swift 
import VARkit

class ARViewController: VARViewController {
    //optional delegate method
    override func statusDidChange(status: VARStatus) {
        super.statusDidChange(status: status)
        
        switch status {
        case .updateStarted(let firstTime):
            print("Updated started: FirstTime: \(firstTime)")
        case .downloadStarted:
            print("Download started")
        case .downloadProgress(let percentage):
            print("Download progress: \(Int(percentage * 100))%")
        case .downloadCompleted:
            print("Download completed")
        case .updateCompleted:
            print("Update completed")
        case .updateFailed(let error):
            print("Update failed: \(error)")
        }
        case .alreadyUpToDate:
            print("Update completed - already up to date")
        @unknown default:
            print("Uknown case")
        }
    }
}
```
